'What is your problem?' When the user answers and presses Enter, the script should simply ignore the userâ€™s input, 
   then prompt the user again with 'Have you had this problem before (yes or no)?' If the user enters 'yes', print 
   'Well, you have it again.'
   If the user answers 'no', print 'Well, you have it now.'

if option2 == 'yes':
    print('Well, you have it again.')
elif option2 == 'no':
    print('Well, you have it now.')
    
This conversation wuld not convince the user that the entity at the other end exhibited intelligent behavior. 
Because there is a clear possibility that the user enters "I don't remember" instead of "no" or another string and the 
program won't return anything
